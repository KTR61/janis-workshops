## About this workshop

This workshop was produced for training at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Workshop 1 is designed to be a gentle introduction to Janis, specifically within a Peter Mac context.

The intended scope:

- What is Janis, 
    - How Janis is different from seqliner (the previous workflow system)
- How to load Janis (with modules),
- How to run a simple workflow,
- How to align some samples,
- How to debug if something goes wrong (check logs),
- How to override amount of resources,
- How to run the same pipeline on cohort of samples,
