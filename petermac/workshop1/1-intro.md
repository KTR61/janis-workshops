# Introduction to Janis at Peter Mac

Janis is workflow framework that uses Python to construct a declarative workflow. It has a simple workflow API within Python that you use to build your workflow. Janis converts your pipeline to the Common Workflow Language (CWL) and Workflow Description Language (WDL) for execution, and itâ€™s also great for publishing and archiving.

Janis can run pipelines at Peter Mac, as it knows how to interact with Slurm.

This tutorial has a bioinformatics focus, although Janis is generic as a workflow assistant and can be used outside of the computational genomics.

## Learning outcomes

In this workshop, we'll learn:

- What is Janis, 
    - How Janis is different from seqliner
- How to load a Janis environment,
- How to run a simple workflow,
- How to align some samples.
- How to debug if something goes wrong (check logs)
- How to override amount of resources
- How to run same pipeline on cohort of samples,


## Foundations

- A workflow is a collection of tools are run in an organised manner.

- A workflow specification is a format that exactly describes the relatinoship between your tools. Popular workflow specification types include:

    - Common Workflow Language (CWL)
    - Workflow Description Language (WDL)
    - [_Unsupported_] Nextflow
    - [_Unsupported_] Snakemake

- Janis uses an _abstracted execution environment_ which removes the shared file system you're used to.

    - For a file or directory to be available to your tool, you need to EXPLICITLY include it. 
        - This includes associated files, if you want an indexed bam, you must use the BamBai type.

    - Outputs of tools must be EXPLICITLY collected, else they will be removed.
        - This is equivalent to a _SAVE_ stage in seqliner.

    - A step's requirements (its inputs) can be an input to a workflow, or the output of a previous step (hence creating a dependency).

    _Diagram_

- In Janis, all tasks are executed inside a isolated virtual environment called a [_Container_](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container). Docker and Singularity are two common container types. (Docker containers can be executed by Singularity.)


## Getting started

Create a folder called `janis-workshop1` in a location where you have plenty of storage (we'd recommend you researcher folder).
